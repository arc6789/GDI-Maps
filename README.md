# GDI-Maps

Using Meetup's Restful APi and Mapbox's javascript library, this map plots upcomming meetup events and lists certain event informations for any particular meetup group. 
The idea is to integrate this map into Girl Develop it San Jose Chapter's website page. 

Bootstrap's css library is included.

## How to use this map:
  + Visit <a href="https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/" target="_blank"> this link </a> to obtain your personal Meetup api key. You need to have a Meetup account for this step. If you don't then sign up for an account and visit the link above.
  + Click unlock and copy and paste your key exactly as is (without any spaces) into the "Meetup Key" field above.
  + Visit the Meetup group you are interested in locating events for. The url you see in your browser is going to likely look something formatted like this http://www.meetup.com/etc-etc-etc/
  + Copy and paste whatever you see (exactly as is. no spaces) inbetween the forward slashs in the "Meetup Event" field above. For example "etc-etc-etc" 
  + Input your Meetup city formated exactly like this "City, State" (no quotes). For example "San Jose, CA"
  + Click "Submit"

  *Note: Some Meetup events are only displayed to members of the group. So if you are not part of a specific group you may not see the full list of upcoming events
